/**
	Set the text to speech voice's volume (how loud it is).
	void tts_voice::set_volume(int volume);
	## Arguments:
		* int volume: the desired volume level.
	## Remarks:
		0 is silent, 100 is louded. If this hasn't been assigned, it will use the OS setting which may not be 100%. Beware if running old code, this is different from bgt having 0 be the max. It's better to use this instead of directly setting volume property.
*/

// Example:
void main() {
	tts_voice v;
	v.set_volume(50);
	v.speak("This is at 50 volume");
	v.set_volume(100);
	v.speak_wait("this is at 100 volume");
}
